To run the program you must install a Java runtime environment.
Either openJDK or sun's jre version 5 or higher.

To compile the program you must have the respective jdk.

(3) Browsing and change the source code
=======================================

Before you try to understand the program structure it is
strongly recommended to run "ant javadoc" to create the API 
documentation and have a look on the general overview.

You start the API documentation with your favorite browser.
Here you find the index file: "build/javadoc/index.html".
  
You can browse and modify the source code with eclipse.
In the src directory (the source code starting directory) there
are the files ".classpath" and ".project" for eclipse.

The program use pure swing and is NOT build with any 
gui bilder. Therefore it is not necessary to run eclipse 
but it is recommended.

You make the exec file with the free installer for Windows programs "Inno setup".
Download it from   "http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php"
